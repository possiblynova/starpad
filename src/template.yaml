# StarPad
# Â© Nova Davis - 2023
# A Novation LaunchPad PRO interface that allows you to bind buttons to keys/sequences
# Originally intended for playing StarCraft II

# --- Pads --- #
# Pads are the keys into the binds dictionary that define what pad you press to trigger an action
#   For square grid pads, use:
#     !Grid [x, y]:
#   ... where x and y are the position of the pad, starting at 1, going right and up respectively
#   For edge buttons use their name:
#     Top (left -> right):
#       Up
#       Down
#       Left
#       Right
#       Session
#       Note
#       Device
#       User
#     Bottom (left -> right):
#       RecordArm
#       TrackSelect
#       Mute
#       Solo
#       Volume
#       Pan
#       Sends
#       StopClip
#     Left (top -> bottom):
#       Shift
#       Click
#       Undo
#       Delete
#       Quantise
#       Duplicate
#       Double
#       Record
#     Right (top -> bottom):
#       A
#       B
#       C
#       D
#       E
#       F
#       G
#       H

# --- Fields --- #
# Inside each bind, there are multiple fields, all have a default value if omitted
#   press
#     - Accepts a KeySequence (see below) that defines what actions to perform when the pad is pressed
#     - Surround the sequence in single ('sequence') or double ("sequence") quotes
#     - Defaults to ''
#   release
#     - Accepts a KeySequence (see below) that defines what actions to perform when the pad is released
#     - Surround the sequence in single ('sequence') or double ("sequence") quotes
#     - Defaults to ''
#   active
#     - Accepts a Color (see below), which is one of the following
#           !Palette n
#         ...where n is the 0-127 palette number of the color (see: http://www.launchpadfun.com/downloads/Velocity-Colors_MASTER_PICTURE_hires.png)
#           !Rgb [r, g, b]
#         ...where r, g, and b are red, green, and blue values in the range of 0-63
#     - Defaults to green: !Palette 21
#   inactive
#     - Accepts a Color (see below)
#     - Defaults to red: !Palette 5
#   threshold
#     - Accepts a velocity from 0-127 which is the minimum velocity at which the pad is counted as pressed
#     - If the pad is not a square pad and/or the velocity setting is off, pressed is 127 velocity
#     - If polyphonic aftertouch is enabled and the pressure drops below the set velocity, the pad is counted as released
#     - Defaults to 0, meaning any press will trigger it

# --- Colors --- #
# Colors can be one of the following:
#     !Palette n
#   ...where n is the 0-127 palette number of the color (see: http://www.launchpadfun.com/downloads/Velocity-Colors_MASTER_PICTURE_hires.png)
#     !Rgb [r, g, b]
#   ...where r, g, and b are red, green, and blue values in the range of 0-63

# --- KeySequences --- #
# KeySequences are the core of StarPad, defining how actions work
# If you've ever used AutoHotKey before, this shouldn't be too difficult to understand
#   To tap the A key:
#     "a"
#   To tap the B key while holding shift (type capital B):
#     "+b"
#   To press and hold both the alt and C keys:
#     ">!c"
#   To release the f2 key:
#     "<(f2)"
# You get the idea, here's a quick reference:
#   - Non-special characters are directly typed if they have a direct key mapping (don't require shift to press)
#   - The order of modifiers and prefixes are in does not matter as long as they're contiguous
#   - Modifier event ordering:
#     - If tapping a key:
#       1. Presses shift
#       2. Taps the key
#       3. Releases shift
#     - If pressing a key:
#       1. Presses shift
#       2. Presses the key
#     - If releasing a key:
#       1. Releases the key
#       2. Releases the modifier
#   - The ! modifier indicates alt
#   - The ^ modifier indicates ctrl
#   - The + modifier indicates shift
#   - The > prefix only presses the key
#   - The < prefix only releases the key
#   - Omitting both > and < taps the key
#   - Certain non-typable keys can also be used by surrounding their lowercase name in parentheses:
#     Alt: (alt)
#     Ctrl: (ctrl)
#     Shift: (shift)
#     Enter: (enter)
#     Backspace: (backspace)
#     Tab: (tab)
#     Caps Lock: (caps)
#     Space: (space)
#     Apps: (menu)
#     Numpad 0: (#0)
#     Numpad 1: (#1)
#     Numpad 2: (#2)
#     Numpad 3: (#3)
#     Numpad 4: (#4)
#     Numpad 5: (#5)
#     Numpad 6: (#6)
#     Numpad 8: (#8)
#     Numpad 9: (#9)
#     f1: (f1)
#     f2: (f2)
#     f3: (f3)
#     f4: (f4)
#     f5: (f5)
#     f6: (f6)
#     f8: (f8)
#     f9: (f9)
#     f10: (f10)
#     f11: (f11)
#     f12: (f12)
#     f13: (f13)
#     f14: (f14)
#     f15: (f15)
#     f16: (f16)
#     f17: (f17)
#     f18: (f18)
#     f19: (f19)
#     f20: (f20)
#     f21: (f21)
#     f22: (f22)
#     f23: (f23)
#     f24: (f24)

--- # Put your binds *below* this line

# Example that binds the "Record Arm" button to F2 (usually "Select All Army Units" in SC2)
RecordArm:
  press: '(f2)'
  inactive: !Rgb [63, 63, 63]
  active: !Rgb [0, 63, 63]
  threshold: 63
